# Game: Luna-Eggzy-and-The-Cat

Luna and Eggzy (yes, from Kingsman, The Secret Service) are our two Japanese Spitz doggies. They are mother and daughter, Luna is the mom. They have very different relationships with our cat. Luna and the cat are best friends, but Eggzy and the cat are enemies. Luna and Eggzy have a nice mother daughter relationship full of support and snuggles.

This is a game in which the cat endlessly attacks you (Eggzy), but the larger Luna's don't.

You, as Eggzy, have to keep avoiding the cat. If you come into contact with the cat, you die and the game is over.
